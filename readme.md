# timer
An open source cross-platform (Windows/macOS/linux) timer app
written in [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)

![timer app demo](img/demo.gif)

## Installation instructions
* Download zip from Releases
* Unzip archive
* Run executable file

## development instructions
* `npm start` - start a dev environment with `NODE_ENV=dev`, which amongst
  other things enables `electron-reload` (app automatically refreshes on file
changes) and enables chrome dev tools which are
otherwise disabled
* `npm run start-prod` - Start an environment similar to what is generated by
  the build process for production. No dev tools, no `electron-reload` etc
* `npm run make` - runs `electron-forge make` which produces an executable
  file. Will by default generate an executable for the current platform, but
with options can generate for other platforms too.

## TODO
* More sophisticated parsing for timer, i.e. `5 minutes`, `1 hour and 15
  minutes`, etc. should work
* Implement terminal-like command history, ie. hitting up and down arrow keys
  within the timer input field should navigate through timer history
* Let user change audio volume of alert
* Let user toggle audio alert on/off
* Let user toggle focus on timer end on/off
* Let user change alert sound
